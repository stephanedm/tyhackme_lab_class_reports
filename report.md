nmap,wazuh and msf labs

# sammary
This is a report of cybersecurity tryhackme and hack the box labs class work. the task was to complete the nmap labs, wazuh and metasploit labs and gain experience.
i successfully completed those labs, i used nmap to scan and identify active hosts and services, analysed logs and monitor system activity using wazuh and used metasploit to exploit identified weaknesses and practice privilege-escalation techniques.
the labs were challenging and offered hands-on lab experience with real-world tools.

# introduction
This report presents the results of completing cybersecurity practical labs on TryHackMe and Hack The Box. The main objective was to gain hands-on experience with three essential security tools: Nmap, Wazuh, and Metasploit. Through these exercises, I practiced core cybersecurity skills including reconnaissance, host discovery, log analysis, threat monitoring, vulnerability exploitation, and privilege escalation.
These labs were designed to simulate real-world environments, enabling the development of both offensive and defensive security capabilities. The practical challenges were demanding but highly valuable, reinforcing theoretical knowledge with real application.

# objectives

>The primary goals of the lab work were:
>To apply network scanning and enumeration techniques using Nmap
>To analyze security logs and monitor workloads using Wazuh
>To exploit vulnerable systems using Metasploit
>To understand attacker methodology and defensive detection strategies
>To develop technical confidence with real security tools
>To strengthen problem-solving and analytical thinking in cybersecurity scenarios

# methodology

* Host Discovery & Enumeration with Nmap

>Started with basic ping sweeps to identify active machines
>Performed detailed port scans to enumerate open services
>Conducted service and version detection to identify vulnerabilities
>Analyzed network responses to understand potential attack surfaces

* Monitoring & Threat Detection with Wazuh

>Collected system logs from monitored endpoints
>Reviewed alerts generated by the Wazuh security engine
>Investigated suspicious events such as failed logins, privilege changes, or unusual file access
>Used dashboards to visualize system behavior and detect anomalies

* Exploitation & Privilege Escalation with Metasploit

>Identified vulnerabilities based on Nmap findings
>Selected and configured appropriate Metasploit modules
>Executed exploits to gain initial access
>Used post-exploitation modules to escalate privileges and gather system information
>Analyzed results and documented the attack chain


# results

>Successfully identified active hosts and open services using Nmap
>Detected potential weaknesses based on unpatched or outdated services
>Observed real-time alerting in Wazuh when attacks were executed
>Successfully exploited multiple vulnerabilities using Metasploit
>Gained unauthorized access to test systems in a controlled lab environment
>Practiced multiple privilege-escalation paths depending on system configuration
>Improved understanding of how attackers move through a system and how defenders detect them

# conclusion 

The completion of the Nmap, Wazuh, and Metasploit labs on TryHackMe and Hack The Box provided me with valuable hands‑on experience in core cybersecurity workflows. Throughout these exercises, I learned how to identify active hosts and exposed services using Nmap, how to monitor and analyze system activity through Wazuh, and how to exploit real vulnerabilities using Metasploit.
These labs were challenging but highly practical, reinforcing essential skills used by security analysts, penetration testers, and incident responders in real‑world environments. They also strengthened my problem‑solving abilities, my analytical thinking, and my understanding of how attackers approach targets—and how defenders can detect and prevent such attacks.
Overall, this practical experience significantly increased my confidence in using professional cybersecurity tools and gave me a stronger foundation to continue advancing in offensive and defensive security.
